# WHAT WAS THE PROMPT?

- This is a program that I found online, including the parser which converts input into a row matrix format

- This program simply uses an algorithm to convert any combination of matrix into 'Reduced Row Echelon Form', which is considered a simplified format for solving systems of linear equations.

# HOW DID THIS PROJECT COME INTO FRUITION?

- This small program was created as I was researching graphics and learnt about the importance of matrixes and transformations within them, as well how linear equations are important for planes (2D,3D,4D etc), and matrixes. As a result, I discovered Reduced Row Echelon Form which is important for resolving linear equations.

- Moreover, after discovering the algorithm and researching matrixes, I came across an online calculator that implemented the algorithm and provided a Row Reduced Echelon Form output based on the given matrix input. I therefore challenged myself to make my own very basic implementation of the calculator, with the algorithm correctly resolving a matrix so that it was outputted correctly into Reduced Row Echelon form, regardless of the size nor difficulty of said matrix. 

- I found a parser online (as mentioned above) that would format the input into row matrix format (format seen in the format that is ordered just as a matrix typically is), which simplifies user input.

# WHAT DID THIS PROJECT TEACH ME?

- This project reinforced the basics of any programming language, being loops, if statements and the importance of trying to avoid hardcoding. Ultimately, it helped me become more important with Python and build my skill range with the language.

- Matrixes outputted by this program can be checked against the original motivation for this project, the online calculator that converts matrixes into Reduced Row Echelon Form:
