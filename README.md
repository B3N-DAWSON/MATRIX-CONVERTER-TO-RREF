# What is this program? (Matrix to Reduced Row Echelon Form). 

- This program uses a simple algorithm in Python in order to put any formation of a matrix into Reduced Row Echelon Form. 

- This program taught me the importance of loops, avoiding hardcoding, ...

### Motive for this program 

- This small program was created as I was researching graphics and learnt about the importance of matrixes and transformations within them, as well how linear equations are important for planes (2D,3D,4D etc), and matrixes. As a result, I discovered Reduced Row Echelon Form which is important for resolving linear equations. I was fascinated about resolving matrixes and how they are done before releasing there was an algorithm I could use in place of an online calculator to further my interest on this topic.
