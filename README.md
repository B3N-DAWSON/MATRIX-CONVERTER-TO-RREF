# WHAT WAS THE PROMPT?

- This is a program that I found online, including the parser which converts input into a row matrix format

- This program simply uses an algorithm to convert any combination of matrix into 'Reduced Row Echelon Form', which is considered a simplified format for solving systems of linear equations.

# HOW DID THIS PROJECT COME INTO FRUITION?

- This small program was created as I was researching graphics and learnt about the importance of matrixes and transformations within them, as well how linear equations are important for planes (2D,3D,4D etc), and matrixes. As a result, I discovered Reduced Row Echelon Form which is important for resolving linear equations. I was fascinated about resolving matrixes and how they are done before releasing there was an algorithm I could use in place of an online calculator to further my interest on this topic.

# WHAT DID THIS PROJECT TEACH ME?

- This project reinforced the basics of any programming language, being loops, if statements and the importance of trying to avoid hardcoding. Ultimately, it helped me become more important with Python and build my skill range with the language.
